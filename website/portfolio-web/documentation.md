## Design desktop 
THe colours I will be using fir the site will be navy blue and gray as I spent a lot of my life in sea scouts and am planning on join the navy in the future and i feel these are the colour that best refteced that.

## Accessibilty 

The way I have followed the accessibilty standard is by looking at the most up to date guidelines the WCAG 2 ,which has 4 main sections 
1.Perceivable 

The way I have made my website perceivable to by giving it a simple clear they out that will work on most devices.

2.Operable

The way I have made sure my site is operable to by testing the navigation of it with out the use of a mouse.

3.Uderstandable 

One way i have maybe my website understandabe to by putting a javasctriped validtion on the contac form.

4.Robust 

I  have made it robsut by following best practices.


## GDPR

To conform with the GDPR I have created a privcy policy telling users of the site how the data will be used how it will be stored and what their rigths are.

## Online and distance selling

I do not need to conform to the Online and distance selling as I am not selling any goods or services.

## Evaluation
I beleive I have tackled the problem I set out to solve ,I have a good platform to now disply myself for future employs to see in a simple east to read format.

The main problems I encountered was the layout and sizing of everything. I solved this by trial and error to get the best fit for everyting on my site.

The images that are currently on there are just places holders unit i get my own photos to dispay.

I tested my site using google chrome and the inspect feture.I ran the audits feature to see my accessibilty and best practices score which i got 93 for both.
